# Nauthilus

Nauthilus is a general purpose authentication service. It is designed to work as a central place where all kinds of authentication requests are handled. No matter if you need to authenticate users from a mail server or a web page. Services are connected to Nauthilus.

The service uses standard HTTP for communication with other servers. Authentication requests and responses are made by adding headers or returning JSON. The original design was taken from Nginx.
