:::danger Deprecated Feature
This functionality has been dropped in version 1.8.0 and is no longer available.
:::

```lua
dynamic_loader("nauthilus_neural")
local nauthilus_neural = require("nauthilus_neural")
```

## add_additional_features

Adds custom features to the authentication state for neural network processing. These features can be used by the neural network for more accurate brute force detection.

### Syntax

```lua
nauthilus_neural.add_additional_features(features_table, encoding_type)
```

### Parameters

- `features_table` (table): A table containing key-value pairs of features to add
- `encoding_type` (string, optional): The encoding type to use for string features. Valid values are:
  - `"one-hot"` (default): Uses one-hot encoding for string features
  - `"embedding"`: Uses embedding encoding for string features

### Notes

- The function does not return any values
- Features with keys "ClientIP", "client_ip", "Username", or "username" are automatically skipped
- If called multiple times, new features are merged with existing ones
- This function is available from Nauthilus version 1.7.7
- The experimental_ml feature must be enabled for these features to be used

### Example

```lua
dynamic_loader("nauthilus_neural")
local nauthilus_neural = require("nauthilus_neural")

-- Add custom features with default one-hot encoding
nauthilus_neural.add_additional_features({
  user_agent = request.headers["User-Agent"],
  login_time = os.time(),
  device_type = "mobile",
  location = "office"
})

-- Add features with embedding encoding for string values
nauthilus_neural.add_additional_features({
  browser_info = request.headers["User-Agent"],
  referrer = request.headers["Referer"]
}, "embedding")
```

## set_learning_mode

Toggles the neural network learning mode on or off. When learning mode is enabled, the system collects data but does not use the neural network for predictions. When disabled, the system uses the trained neural network for predictions.

### Syntax

```lua
local learning_mode_state, error_message = nauthilus_neural.set_learning_mode(enabled)
```

### Parameters

- `enabled` (boolean): Whether to enable learning mode (true) or disable it (false)

### Returns

- `learning_mode_state` (boolean): The new learning mode state (true if in learning mode, false otherwise)
- `error_message` (string or nil): Error message if the operation failed, nil otherwise

### Example

```lua
dynamic_loader("nauthilus_neural")
local nauthilus_neural = require("nauthilus_neural")

-- Enable learning mode
local is_learning, error = nauthilus_neural.set_learning_mode(true)
if error then
  print("Failed to enable learning mode: " .. error)
else
  print("Learning mode is now: " .. (is_learning and "enabled" or "disabled"))
end

-- Disable learning mode
local is_learning, error = nauthilus_neural.set_learning_mode(false)
if not error then
  print("Learning mode is now: " .. (is_learning and "enabled" or "disabled"))
end
```

### Example

```lua
dynamic_loader("nauthilus_neural")
local nauthilus_neural = require("nauthilus_neural")

-- Provide feedback that a login attempt was NOT a brute force attack (false positive correction)
local success, error = nauthilus_neural.provide_feedback(false, "req-12345", "192.168.1.100", "john.doe")

if not success then
  print("Failed to record feedback: " .. error)
else
  print("Feedback recorded successfully")
end

-- Provide feedback that a login attempt WAS a brute force attack (false negative correction)
local success, error = nauthilus_neural.provide_feedback(true, "req-67890", "10.0.0.5", "admin")
```

### Notes

- This function is available from Nauthilus version 1.7.7
- The experimental_ml feature must be enabled for this function to work
- Feedback is prioritized in training to improve detection accuracy
- When sufficient feedback samples (10 or more) are collected, the system automatically retrains the neural network
- Feedback helps the system learn from its mistakes and continuously improve detection accuracy

## Custom Hook for Feedback

A custom hook is available to provide feedback on neural network predictions via HTTP. This allows you to correct false positives or false negatives remotely without direct server access.

### Configuration

Add the following to your Nauthilus configuration in the `lua.custom_hooks` section:

```yaml
lua:
  custom_hooks:
    - http_location: "neural-feedback"
      http_method: "GET"
      script_path: "/etc/nauthilus/lua-plugins.d/hooks/neural-feedback.lua"
      roles: ["admin"]  # Restrict access to admin users when JWT auth is enabled
```

### Usage

Once configured, you can provide feedback by making a GET request to:

```
/api/v1/custom/neural-feedback
```

#### Query Parameters

- `is_brute_force` (required): Whether the login attempt was actually part of a brute force attack. Valid values are:
  - `true` or `1` or `yes`: It was a brute force attack
  - `false` or `0` or `no`: It was not a brute force attack
- `request_id` (required): The request ID of the login attempt to provide feedback for
- `client_ip` (required): The client IP address of the login attempt
- `username` (required): The username of the login attempt

#### Example

```
GET /api/v1/custom/neural-feedback?is_brute_force=true&request_id=req-12345&client_ip=192.168.1.100&username=john.doe
```

This will provide feedback that the login attempt with request ID "req-12345" from IP "192.168.1.100" for username "john.doe" was actually part of a brute force attack.

### Response

The hook returns a JSON response with the result:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Feedback recorded successfully",
  "is_brute_force": true,
  "request_id": "req-12345",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "username": "john.doe"
}
```

Or in case of an error:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to record feedback",
  "error": "Error message details",
  "is_brute_force": true,
  "request_id": "req-12345",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "username": "john.doe"
}
```

## How the Feedback System Works

The neural network feedback system creates a continuous improvement loop for brute force detection accuracy:

1. **Feedback Collection**: Administrators or security systems provide feedback on predictions through the Lua API or HTTP hook
2. **Prioritized Training**: Feedback samples are marked in the training data and prioritized during model retraining
3. **Automatic Retraining**: When 10 or more feedback samples are collected, the system automatically retrains the neural network
4. **Improved Accuracy**: The retrained model incorporates the feedback, reducing false positives and false negatives
5. **Learning Mode Transition**: If the system was in learning mode, collecting enough feedback can automatically transition it to prediction mode

### Benefits of the Feedback System

- **Continuous Improvement**: The system gets better over time as it learns from its mistakes
- **Reduced False Positives**: Fewer legitimate users are incorrectly flagged as attackers
- **Reduced False Negatives**: More actual attacks are correctly identified
- **Adaptive Learning**: The system adapts to your specific environment and threat patterns
- **Faster Training**: Feedback-triggered training uses more epochs (100 vs. 50) for better learning
- **Automatic Operation**: No manual intervention required once feedback is provided

### Implementation Details

The feedback system is implemented with the following components:

- **Feedback Storage**: Feedback samples are stored in Redis with a special flag
- **Prioritized Training**: The training algorithm gives special attention to feedback samples
- **Automatic Retraining**: A background process checks for feedback samples and triggers retraining
- **Model Persistence**: The improved model is saved to Redis for use by all Nauthilus instances
- **Learning Mode Management**: The system can automatically transition from learning to prediction mode

## Custom Hook for Training
