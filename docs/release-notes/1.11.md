# 1.11.x Release Notes

This page summarizes notable changes in the 1.11 minor series. Patch-level releases are listed below.

> 1.11 focuses on higher throughput, production-friendly logging, and improved Redis connectivity under load. The foundation has been optimized substantially.

## 1.11.3

New
- Redis: In‑process account name cache (server.redis.account_local_cache) to reduce repeated lookups for frequently used users. Disabled by default.
- Redis: Client‑side command batching (server.redis.batching) to pipeline small commands and reduce round‑trips under load. Disabled by default.
- HTTP middlewares: Feature switches to enable/disable individual middlewares (server.middlewares), including logging, limit, recovery, trusted_proxies, request_decompression, response_compression, and metrics. Enabled by default unless explicitly set to false.

Documentation
- Server Configuration updated with defaults and YAML examples for the new Redis features.
- Full Configuration Example updated accordingly.

## Highlights

- New log level: notice
  - Emits essential, high-signal events suited for production.
- Redis connection and timeout tuning
  - Better pooling defaults and improved behavior under network hiccups; clear guidance for pool sizing.
- Core runtime optimizations
  - Significantly reduced overhead in hot paths for higher request throughput.

## Configuration changes (New in v1.11.0)

### Logging

- server.log.level supports a new level: notice
  - Intended for production to keep logs concise while preserving operational visibility.

Example:
```yaml
server:
  log:
    level: notice
```

### Redis

- Connection handling tuned for busy deployments.
- Time budget enforcement aligns with server.timeouts.redis_read and server.timeouts.redis_write.
- Guidance for pool tuning added to Server Configuration.

See:
- Configuration → Server Configuration → Redis → Connection and timeout tuning
- Configuration → Server Configuration → Timeouts

## Performance

- Internal subsystems refactored to reduce allocations and contention in authentication flows.
- Improved connection reuse and reduced churn for Redis workloads.

## Compatibility

- No breaking configuration changes compared to 1.10.
- The new notice level is additive and fully backward compatible.

### Lua runtime loading

- The legacy dynamic_loader has been removed. Calls to dynamic_loader are now no-ops and emit a warning to the log if invoked. Use plain `require("<module>")` in Lua scripts.

## Upgrade notes

- Review your logging configuration and consider using notice in production.
- Revisit Redis pool_size and idle_pool_size if you previously tuned around connection churn.
- Validate timeouts for redis_read and redis_write against your network conditions.
