# 1.8.x Release Notes

This page summarizes notable changes in the 1.8 minor series. Patch-level releases are listed below.

## 1.8.9

### Parallel execution for Lua features and filters

- Features and Filters now execute in parallel. Nauthilus waits for all scripts to complete and aggregates their results; if any script requests action, enforcement is applied. See the notes in the Lua API introduction for details about concurrency and aggregation behavior.
- Status messages from concurrent scripts are merged using a "first non-empty wins" policy. See Builtin.status_message_set for concurrency notes.

### In-process Lua Cache API

- New process-wide cache module for Lua to store data across requests with optional TTLs.
- Thread-safe operations, lazy and background cleanup of expired entries.

- Cache API: /docs/lua-api/cache

## 1.8.8

### Redis pipelining support

- Added nauthilus_redis.redis_pipeline to batch multiple Redis commands in a single round-trip, reducing latency and improving throughput for bulk operations.

- Redis API: /docs/lua-api/redis

## 1.8.5

### HTTP response API (initial)

- Introduced nauthilus_http_response to set/modify HTTP response headers from Lua.
- Note: Setting status code and writing a response body were added later in 1.9.0; additional helpers arrived in 1.9.2.

- HTTP response API: /docs/lua-api/http-response

## 1.8.2

### Password utilities

- Added nauthilus_password.generate_password_hash to generate the short, Redis-compatible password hash used server-side (for correlation/logging). See Password API for caveats and examples.

- Password API: /docs/lua-api/password

## 1.8.0

### Removal of experimental Neural Network feature

- The experimental machine learning based brute-force detection and related Lua API (nauthilus_neural) were removed.
- Configuration references to the neural network feature are no longer applicable.

- Neural API (deprecated notice): /docs/lua-api/neural
