# 1.9.x Release Notes

This page summarizes notable changes in the 1.9 minor series. Patch-level releases are listed below.

## 1.9.4

Date: 2025-09-11

### IPv6 ip_scoping for Repeating‑Wrong‑Password and Tolerations

Two new configuration options allow aggregating IPv6 addresses by network rather than strict /128 in contexts where
privacy extensions commonly rotate interface identifiers. This improves stability of detection for IPv6 households and
multi-device environments.

Added under `brute_force.ip_scoping`:

- `rwp_ipv6_cidr` — Applies to Repeating‑Wrong‑Password (PW_HIST) lookups and counters.
- `tolerations_ipv6_cidr` — Applies to Tolerations keys and housekeeping.

Behavior:
- When set to a value > 0 (range 1..128), IPv6 addresses are normalized to the configured network CIDR (e.g., 2001:db8::/64)
  for the respective subsystem. IPv4 behavior is unchanged.
- Defaults to `0` (disabled) to keep legacy behavior (/128) unless explicitly enabled.

Example:
```yaml
brute_force:
  ip_scoping:
    rwp_ipv6_cidr: 64
    tolerations_ipv6_cidr: 64
```

Related changes:
- Cache flush is aware of ip_scoping: `/api/v1/cache/flush` now removes both raw (/128) and CIDR-scoped variants of keys
  so that no scoped keys linger in Redis after a user flush.

### Stability fix for Repeating‑Wrong‑Password after cache flush

A logic fix prevents immediate brute-force bucket increments when the negative password history is empty for a known
account (e.g., right after a cache flush or first failed attempt). In this situation, the system now gracefully learns
client IP metadata (protocol/OIDC) and avoids enforcement that could lead to self-lockout.

Notes:
- This change only affects the path where the account exists but no negative password history is present.
- Normal brute-force detection and enforcement remain unchanged in other scenarios.

### New option: brute_force.pw_history_for_known_accounts

Reduce PW_HIST write amplification for already‑blocked (cached) requests. When enabled, Nauthilus only writes
account‑scoped PW_HIST for verified accounts (no fallback to raw usernames). IP‑wide PW_HIST remains unchanged.

Why this can be useful:
- Significantly reduces Redis key footprint and write load during credential‑stuffing with rotating/non‑existent usernames.

Minimal risk:
- After unlock or cache flush, the missing per‑username PW_HIST for unknown usernames removes a small quick‑skip signal
  for "repeating wrong password". Buckets may increment a bit sooner until context is re‑learned; metrics/forensics for
  such usernames are less granular.

Config:
```yaml
brute_force:
  pw_history_for_known_accounts: true
```
