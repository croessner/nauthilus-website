## Processing Activities

### Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website

**Type and Purpose of Data Processing**
When you visit our website, i.e., without registering or otherwise providing information, certain general information is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes:

- Type of web browser
- Operating system used
- Domain name of your internet service provider
- Your IP address
- Similar technical data

**Purpose of Data Processing:**

- Ensuring a smooth connection to the website
- Ensuring proper functionality of the website
- Evaluating system security and stability as well as detecting potential misuse

We do not use this data to draw conclusions about your identity. However, we reserve the right to review server log files retrospectively if there are concrete indications of unlawful use.

### Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest

The data processing is carried out under **Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR** based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website and ensuring system security.

### Recipients

Recipients of the data may include technical service providers acting as data processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.

### Retention Period

Data stored in server log files is kept for a maximum of **seven days** unless a security-related event occurs (e.g., a DDoS attack). In such cases, server log files may be stored until the security event is fully resolved and investigated.

### Provision Mandatory or Required

Providing the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, some features or services may be unavailable or limited.

## Right to Object

### Right to Object on a Case-by-Case Basis

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data which is based on **Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR** (data processing based on legitimate interests); this also applies to profiling based on those provisions within the meaning of **Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR**.

If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.

### Recipient of an Objection

**Christian Rößner**<br/>
Marburger Str. 70a<br/>

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy to ensure it always complies with current legal requirements or to reflect changes in our services, e.g., when introducing new features. The updated privacy policy will apply for future visits.
