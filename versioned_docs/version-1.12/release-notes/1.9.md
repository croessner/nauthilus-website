# 1.9.x Release Notes

This page summarizes notable changes in the 1.9 minor series. Patch-level releases are listed below.

## 1.9.12

Date: 2025-10-15

Build and packaging changes focusing on optional Hydra/OIDC integration.

Highlights:
- Hydra/OIDC is now gated behind a Go build tag: hydra. The default build (no tags) excludes Hydra, OAuth2/OIDC flows, and their dependencies.
- 2FA (TOTP) and WebAuthn frontend flows are compiled and registered only with the hydra build tag.
- Docker images are built without Hydra by default. To include Hydra, build your own image with BUILD_TAGS=hydra.
- OAuth2/Claims processing has been compile-time isolated. Non-hydra builds remain lean and keep JWT-based service authentication fully intact.

How to build:
- Without Hydra (default):
  - go build -mod=vendor ./server
  - go test ./...
- With Hydra enabled:
  - go build -mod=vendor -tags hydra ./server
  - go test -tags hydra ./...

Docker build examples:
- Default (no Hydra):
  - docker build -t nauthilus:1.9.12 .
- With Hydra enabled:
  - docker build --build-arg BUILD_TAGS=hydra -t nauthilus:1.9.12-hydra .

Operational impact:
- Endpoints for login/consent/device/webauthn and registration are only present in hydra builds. In non-hydra builds these endpoints are not registered (or return 404 via stubs).
- Configuration under the oauth2 section is only effective when built with hydra. It is ignored otherwise.
- Service-internal JWT authentication for REST/Admin endpoints is unaffected and always available.

Documentation updates:
- See Installation → Compiling for build-tag guidance.
- See Installation → Docker for Hydra-enabled image builds.

## 1.9.10

Date: 2025-09-29

### Cold-start grace for brute-force (precision, multi-instance safe)

A new mechanism prevents immediate lockouts right after cache flushes or password changes when multiple devices may still
send the old password in parallel. The system grants a one-time, per-IP grace for known accounts without negative
password history while atomically seeding evidence so that Repeating‑Wrong‑Password can short-circuit concurrent first
attempts without inflating generic buckets.

Highlights:
- One-time grace per scoped IP, then normal enforcement resumes within the configured TTL.
- Atomic Redis Lua script seeds a per-password key alongside the grace key to eliminate races in parallel scenarios.
- Safe in multi-instance deployments via shared Redis and EVALSHA script management.

New configuration (disabled by default):
```yaml
brute_force:
  cold_start_grace_enabled: true       # Enable one-time grace for known accounts without negative PW history
  cold_start_grace_ttl: 120s           # Grace window (recommended 60–180s)
```

Behavior:
- First failed attempt from an IP (scoped consistently with RWP and IPv6 ip_scoping): learn metadata, do not enforce yet.
- Concurrent first attempts are recognized via the atomic seed and treated as repeating wrong password.
- From the next attempt within the TTL: enforcement resumes so complex buckets fill/trigger as usual.

Documentation:
- Configuration reference updated: /docs/configuration/brute-force#brute_forcecold_start_grace_enabled-v1910

## 1.9.9

Date: 2025-09-24

Highlights:
- Brotli response compression middleware, aligned with existing zstd middleware semantics (skipper, exclusions, min_length).
- Brotli request decompression: Requests with `Content-Encoding: br` are automatically decompressed when compression is enabled.
- Algorithm selection by preference order now supports `br` in addition to `zstd` and `gzip`.
- Configuration options extended with `level_brotli` to control Brotli compression strength.
- Deprecated `server.compression.level` (gzip) in favor of `server.compression.level_gzip` for consistency.

Configuration changes:
- `server.compression.algorithms` may now include `"br"` (Brotli). Example:

```yaml
server:
  compression:
    enabled: true
    algorithms: ["br", "zstd", "gzip"]
```

- New: `server.compression.level_brotli` (0..3) maps to middleware levels similar to zstd:
  - 0 = DefaultCompression
  - 1 = BestSpeed
  - 2 = BetterCompression
  - 3 = BestCompression

```yaml
server:
  compression:
    enabled: true
    algorithms: ["br", "zstd", "gzip"]
    level_brotli: 2
```

- Deprecated: `server.compression.level` → Use `server.compression.level_gzip` instead (still accepted for backward compatibility).

```yaml
server:
  compression:
    # Deprecated, prefer level_gzip
    level: 6
    # New
    level_gzip: 6
```

- Existing: `level_zstd` (0..3) and `min_length` remain available and unchanged.

For the full description of options, see the Server Configuration: /docs/configuration/server-configuration#compression-configuration

Behavior:
- Only one response compression algorithm is active at a time, chosen by the configured `algorithms` order and the client’s `Accept-Encoding`.
- Request decompression now covers gzip, zstd (zstd/zst/zstandard), and Brotli (br) when compression is enabled.
- The `/metrics` endpoint continues to disable response compression to avoid double compression by Prometheus.

Implementation notes:
- Brotli compression implemented using `github.com/andybalholm/brotli`.
- Zstandard compression implemented using `github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd`.

Migration notes:
- If you previously set `server.compression.level`, migrate to `server.compression.level_gzip`.
- To enable Brotli for compatible clients, add `"br"` to `server.compression.algorithms` and optionally configure `level_brotli`.

Thanks:
Thanks to all contributors and users for feedback leading to this improvement in performance and bandwidth efficiency.

## 1.9.8

Date: 2025-09-23

Highlights:
- Zstandard (zstd) response compression via a new middleware (analog to gin-contrib/gzip).
- Zstandard request decompression: incoming requests with Content-Encoding: zstd/zst/zstandard are automatically decompressed when compression is enabled.
- Configurable algorithm preference and zstd levels via new configuration keys.

Details:
- New config keys under server.compression:
  - algorithms: ordered list of enabled algorithms (e.g., ["zstd", "gzip"]). Only one algorithm is applied per response; the first supported by the client wins.
  - level_zstd: integer mapping for zstd encoder levels (0=DefaultCompression, 1=BestSpeed, 2=BetterCompression, 3=BestCompression).
  - min_length: remains supported to avoid compressing very small responses.
- Gzip keeps using the existing level (1..9). The deprecated content_types remains ignored (since 1.9.2) and should be removed from configs.
- Implementation uses klauspost/compress v1.18.0 for zstd.
- The /metrics endpoint keeps compression disabled to avoid double compression with Prometheus.

Docs:
- Configuration reference updated with algorithms, level_zstd, and examples.
- Full configuration example updated accordingly.

## 1.9.5

Date: 2025-09-11

### Breaking change (JSON REST): `protocol` replaces `service`

- The JSON authentication endpoint (`POST /api/v1/auth/json`) now uses the field `protocol` (e.g., `"imap"`, `"smtp"`, `"pop3"`, `"http"`) to determine the application protocol.
- The JSON field `service` no longer controls protocol selection and is ignored by this endpoint.
- Header-based (`/api/v1/auth/header`) and form-based (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) endpoints are unchanged.

Migration for JSON clients:
- Replace `"service": "imap"` with `"protocol": "imap"` in request payloads.
- If you previously relied on `service` to switch behavior, make sure to provide `protocol` explicitly. If omitted, Nauthilus will apply internal defaults, which may not match your intended workflow.

Documentation updates:
- REST API documentation updated to reflect the `protocol` field and to highlight this change.

## 1.9.4

Date: 2025-09-11

### IPv6 ip_scoping for Repeating‑Wrong‑Password and Tolerations

Two new configuration options allow aggregating IPv6 addresses by network rather than strict /128 in contexts where
privacy extensions commonly rotate interface identifiers. This improves stability of detection for IPv6 households and
multi-device environments.

Added under `brute_force.ip_scoping`:

- `rwp_ipv6_cidr` — Applies to Repeating‑Wrong‑Password (PW_HIST) lookups and counters.
- `tolerations_ipv6_cidr` — Applies to Tolerations keys and housekeeping.

Behavior:
- When set to a value > 0 (range 1..128), IPv6 addresses are normalized to the configured network CIDR (e.g., 2001:db8::/64)
  for the respective subsystem. IPv4 behavior is unchanged.
- Defaults to `0` (disabled) to keep legacy behavior (/128) unless explicitly enabled.

Example:
```yaml
brute_force:
  ip_scoping:
    rwp_ipv6_cidr: 64
    tolerations_ipv6_cidr: 64
```

Related changes:
- Cache flush is aware of ip_scoping: `/api/v1/cache/flush` now removes both raw (/128) and CIDR-scoped variants of keys
  so that no scoped keys linger in Redis after a user flush.

### Stability fix for Repeating‑Wrong‑Password after cache flush

A logic fix prevents immediate brute-force bucket increments when the negative password history is empty for a known
account (e.g., right after a cache flush or first failed attempt). In this situation, the system now gracefully learns
client IP metadata (protocol/OIDC) and avoids enforcement that could lead to self-lockout.

Notes:
- This change only affects the path where the account exists but no negative password history is present.
- Normal brute-force detection and enforcement remain unchanged in other scenarios.

### New option: brute_force.pw_history_for_known_accounts

Reduce PW_HIST write amplification for already‑blocked (cached) requests. When enabled, Nauthilus only writes
account‑scoped PW_HIST for verified accounts (no fallback to raw usernames). IP‑wide PW_HIST remains unchanged.

Why this can be useful:
- Significantly reduces Redis key footprint and write load during credential‑stuffing with rotating/non‑existent usernames.

Minimal risk:
- After unlock or cache flush, the missing per‑username PW_HIST for unknown usernames removes a small quick‑skip signal
  for "repeating wrong password". Buckets may increment a bit sooner until context is re‑learned; metrics/forensics for
  such usernames are less granular.

Config:
```yaml
brute_force:
  pw_history_for_known_accounts: true
```

### Documentation

- Configuration reference updated to include `brute_force.ip_scoping` options and examples.
- Full configuration example extended with `ip_scoping`.
